Concurrent Link Checker

This is a simple Go program that checks if a list of links are up or down by making HTTP GET requests to them concurrently using goroutines and channels.

Usage

To use the program, simply run the main.go file:

$ go run main.go

The program will create a channel to receive the results, start a goroutine for each link, and then receive the results from the channel.

There are three ways to receive the results:

1. The first way is to use a loop with a fixed number of iterations. This is not very flexible, but it works if you know the number of links in advance.

2. The second way is to use a loop with a range over the channel. This is more flexible, but it requires that the channel is closed when all the results have been received.

3. The final way is to use an anonymous function with a time.Sleep() call inside. This is the most flexible and efficient way, as it allows you to check multiple links concurrently and improves the overall performance of the program.
